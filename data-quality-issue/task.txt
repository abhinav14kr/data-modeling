Evaluate Data Quality Issues in the Data Provided
Using the programming language of your choice (SQL, Python, R, Bash, etc...) identify as many data quality issues as you can. We are not expecting a full blown review of all the data provided, but instead want to know how you explore and evaluate data of questionable provenance.

Commit your code and findings to the git repository along with the rest of the exercise.
